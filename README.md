ðŸš€ AI Command Execution System â€“ Round 2 Submission

Welcome to my Round 2 submission for the **Stematicians AI Internship** program.  
This project demonstrates a **modular, intelligent command execution system** that simulates a lightweight AI model to interpret and respond to system-level commands.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This system simulates a local AI module designed to:
- Accept input commands via a `.json` file
- Process and interpret those commands intelligently
- Generate clean, human-readable responses
- Be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module in larger AI automation systems


ðŸ§  AI Simulation Approach

Rather than training large models like **Mistral** or **LLaMA** (which require high-end hardware), this project:
- Uses **rule-based logic** to simulate decision-making behavior
- Provides a **modular AI interface** (`simulate_ai_response`) for future upgrades
- Can be extended with HuggingFace models like `flan-t5-small` for more advanced NLP
